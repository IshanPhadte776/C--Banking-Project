Ishan's Bank Project

Thank you for looking into this project for me, learning C++ is very difficult, especially when learning on your own. There is no deadline, but this is a personal project 

Project Synopsis

Wanted to Learn C++ and wanted to complete an intro project 
Basic Banking Application where a user (Customer) can sign in via the Command Line Interface, System will verify the credentials, then the user will be asked 



Issues 

Returning an Array and Storing the Content in a variable (Banking Project, main.cpp, line 113                 customerDataObject = createUserData(textOnLine);

2 Folders - Banking Project and Basics 

Banking Project

10 Files

Account, Employee, Customer, Bank Classes
1 Storage File for each class to store details about each object 
Main.cpp (has main method)
Human Class, interface for Employee and Customer Class

Didnâ€™t use .h files, thought they were optional

Basics 

Testing Grounds, Tested each component individually 
Used .h files here, thought that was why I was messing up.
